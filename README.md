BloodBridge: Optimizing Lifesaving Blood Resources

Match Requests with Donors: Identify donors based on blood type.
Automated Notifications: Send SMS alerts to donors about emergency needs.
Nearest Blood Bank Details: Include the location of the nearest blood bank for donors.
Track Last Donation Dates: Filter donors based on eligibility (e.g., donation intervals).
Tech Stack
Backend: Python, Flask
SMS Notifications: Twilio API
Database: CSV (Demo), AWS-hosted database (Future)
Hosting: Local environment (Demo), AWS Cloud (Future)
Demo Setup
Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or above
Install required libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install flask pandas twilio
A valid Twilio account for SMS notifications.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code

Project Status:
This is the initial stage of the project. I will be updating it into a fully functional website intended for a blood donation organization. The project will include features for managing blood donations, donor registration, and connecting with blood banks. Further updates will include website development, cloud deployment, and additional functionalities to enhance user experience.

git clone <repo-url>
cd BloodBridge
Place your donors.csv file in the root directory. Ensure it has the following columns:

text
Copy code
donor_id, name, blood_type, location, email, last_donated, phone_number
Update Twilio credentials in the Python script:

python
Copy code
twilio_sid = "your_twilio_account_sid"
twilio_auth_token = "your_twilio_auth_token"
twilio_phone_number = "your_twilio_phone_number"
Start the Flask server:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Open Postman to test the APIs or use curl.
